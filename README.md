## Boggle Evaluator Web

This application displays a virtual boggle board with letters that can be edited.  When the `Upload Boggle Board` button is clicked, a list of all possible words on the screen are shown.

### Run Locally
`npm start` runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Developer Notes
This application runs within the browser as a React app.  It points to an API that does the actual processing of the boggle board.

### Testing Application
The application is deployed (via Heroku) to https://stormy-refuge-96758.herokuapp.com/.  Please have a look and play around with it. :)
